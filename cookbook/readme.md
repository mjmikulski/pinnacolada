# Cookbook

Welcome to the PINNacolada Cookbook! 

You will find here a collection of scripts that demonstrate the PINN concept, going from trivial examples to more complex ones.

## Basics of gradient 

You can start by reading the intro to gradients ([`gradients/readme.md`](gradients/readme.md)) to grasp the 
concept of in pytorch. You can also jump straight into the dummy introduction to PINN ([`dummy_intro/readme.md`](dummy_intro/readme.md))
and run the scripts to see how training a neural networks that learns a function from its derivative works.

## Simple examples in physics
